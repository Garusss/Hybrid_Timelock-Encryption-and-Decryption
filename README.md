# Hybrid_Timelock-Encryption-and-Decryption
Hybrid time-locked file encryption system built in Python using AES-256-GCM, PBKDF2, trusted online time verification, and a lightweight RSW time-lock puzzle. Prevents early decryption even if system time is modified. Designed for secure, real-world time-based access control.

🚀 Features

🔐 AES-256-GCM for authenticated file encryption
🔑 PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 for secure password-based key derivation
⏳ Lightweight RSW time-lock puzzle (calibrated computational delay)
🌍 Trusted time verification via HTTPS (timeapi.io)
🇳🇵 Nepal-time (Asia/Kathmandu) user input with internal UTC conversion
🛡 SHA-256 integrity verification
🖥 Modern GUI built with CustomTkinter
🔒 Resistant to system clock manipulation attacks


🧠 System Architecture

🔹 Encryption Phase

--> User selects a file.
--> User enters a password.
--> User selects unlock date & time (Nepal Time).
--> System converts Nepal time → UTC internally.
--> File is encrypted using AES-256-GCM.
--> Metadata (salt, nonce, unlock time, RSW puzzle) is stored separately.
--> A small calibrated RSW puzzle is generated for additional cryptographic delay.


🔹 Decryption Phase

--> User selects encrypted file.
--> Password is required again.
--> Current UTC time is fetched securely from a trusted time API.
-->System verifies:
      Trusted UTC >= Stored Unlock UTC


If unlocked:

--> RSW puzzle is solved (small computational delay)
--> AES key is recovered
--> File is decrypted
--> SHA-256 integrity is verified.


🔐 Security Design

This hybrid model protects against:

❌ System clock manipulation
❌ Immediate decryption upon unlock
❌ Unauthorized access without password
❌ File integrity tampering

The system balances usability and cryptographic enforcement by combining real-world time validation with computational delay.
